# Dockerfile Linter (written in Node.js) [![buddy pipeline](https://app.buddy.works/buddy-works/dockerfile-linter/pipelines/pipeline/243198/badge.svg?token=be04e77cb21d0e7e611853e903e521ba233e01d46699a1e6dc00f85a853cbdd6 "buddy pipeline")](https://app.buddy.works/buddy-works/dockerfile-linter/pipelines/pipeline/243198)
## Description

A Dockerfile linter that you can use to quickly check if your Dockerfile follows the [best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) for building efficient Docker images. The tool uses [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) analysis tool to lint code in `RUN` instructions. Some of the rules were inspired by [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) and [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) documentation.

# Installation
The linter requires Node.js to run:

````
npm install --global dockerlinter
````

# Application
## CLI

The linter can be used directly from the CLI:

````
dockerlinter -f <path to Dockerfile>
dockerlinter -f <path to Dockerfile> -s bash #default sh
dockerlinter -f <path to Dockerfile> -s none #disable shellcheck
dockerlinter -f <path to Dockerfile> -i ER0012,ER0015 #coma separated list of ignored rules
````

## Docker
Docker allows you to run the linter on any type of platform. To mount the file, use the `-v` parameter:

````
docker build . -t imagename
docker run -v /tmp/files/dockerfile:/dockerfilelinter/dockerfile imagename linter -f dockerfile
````

# Inline ignores
You can ignore rules for a specific instruction block in the Dockerfile by commenting it. The ignore comment must be applied above the instruction as `# linter ignore=EF0003`. The exceptions are `ED` and `EL` rules. Example:

````
# lint ignore=EF0003,EF0004
FROM node
````

# Rules
The list of rules implemented.

- Rules with the `E` prefix come from `dockerfilelinter`. Implementation can be found in `lib/lints.js`.
- Rules with the `SC` prefix come from `ShellCheck`. You can find their description in the tool's [Wiki](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/). For a more detailed description, use the Pages search tool.

# Maintainer
Docker Linter was created and developed by [Buddy](https://buddy.works?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dockerlinter&utm_content=readme), creators of delivery automation tools for web and software developers.

# CI/CD
The linter was created to validate the Dockerfile syntax in Continuous Integration and Delivery processes and can be used in any CI/CE tool. Buddy natively supports the linter, allowing you to create a pipeline that will check the syntax, build the Docker image and push it to the registry in a few simple steps:

1. First, define when and for what refs (branchs / tags / pull requests) should the pipeline execute:

![Docker Linter](assets/images/docker-linter-1.png)

2. Next, add the `Lint Dockerfile` action and select the Dockerfile to validate:

![Docker Linter](assets/images/docker-linter-2.png)

3. Last, add the Docker build action that will build the image and push it to the registry.

4. You can extend the pipeline to automate other processes in your workflow. For example, automatically update the image on your K8s cluster and notify the QA team in case something goes wrong:
